## General Info

This is a school project where Elijah Murphy, Logan Osher, and Jack Sipple were assigned to create a string modifier project. We were given words that was needed to modify to output a specific string.

## Project Info:
PROBLEM: Given a character string and a list of functions that operate on strings,
calculate the resulting string.  

INPUT: There will be five lines of input. Each line will be a string. Each string will
consist of one or more commands and a character string to operate on. The commands
will be separated from each other by a slash. The order of operation is always from left
to right as the commands appear.  

OUTPUT: For each line of input, print the resulting string.
